# Prototype Pollution Exploits

## Intro

This repository is a collection of exploits for Prototype Pollution vulnerability. If you unfamiliar with the Prototype Pollution vulnerability, please have a look at my another repository https://github.com/Kirill89/prototype-pollution-explained.


The goal of this project is not to collect every possible Prototype Pollution exploit, rather collect exploits for popular packages and in all possible variations â€“ build a dataset for future Prototype Pollution researches.

## Structure

Exploits are stored in separate JS files, e.g. `<package_name>/<method_name>/<payload_type>.js`.

Additionally, each package folder has an MD file with exploits and list of vulnerable versions.

## Exploits

- Utility libraries
  - [lodash](lodash/README.md)
  - [set-value](set-value/README.md)
  - [dot-prop](dot-prop/README.md)
  - [merge](merge/README.md)
  - [deepmerge](deepmerge/README.md)
  - [merge-deep](merge-deep/README.md)
  - [object-path](object-path/README.md)
  - [extend](extend/README.md)
- Parsers
  - [yargs-parser](yargs-parser/README.md)
  - [minimist](minimist/README.md)
  - [ini](ini/README.md)
- Databases
  - [nedb](nedb/README.md)
- Server
