# Prototype Pollution Exploits

## Intro

This repository is a collection of exploits for Prototype Pollution vulnerability. If you unfamiliar with the Prototype Pollution vulnerability, please have a look at my another repository https://github.com/Kirill89/prototype-pollution-explained.

## Structure

Exploits are stored in separate JS files, e.g. `<package_name>/<method_name>/<payload_type>.js`.

Additionally, each package folder has an MD file with exploits and list of vulnerable versions.

## Exploits
